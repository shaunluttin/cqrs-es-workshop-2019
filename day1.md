Fundamentals & Value Proposition

Audits. 
* With event sourcing the current app state is has a provable auditlog.
* With event sourcing we can tell when customers do things (e.g. order on what date).

Distrubuted Systems.
* Local logs of events capture work completed.
* Those local logs then publish.

Developer Velocity
* Removal of accidental complexity because code is aligned with business language.

More Natural Human Implementation Information System (Adam)
* Additional computer memory means we can now keep a ledger.
* These ledgers have been how humans organize for years (medicine, accounting)
* People like a storyline, "how did we get here?"
* Event Sourcing gives us a narrative, a history.
* How we think as humans and Moores Law.

Lossless
* No loss of information.
* Always able to restore transient states.
